# 🩸 BloodBonds — Blood Donation & Emergency Management Platform

A full-stack MERN web application designed to connect blood donors, hospitals, blood banks, and administrators through a centralized emergency blood donation management system.

The platform helps organizations quickly find matching blood donors during emergencies while maintaining secure donor records, donation history tracking, and admin-controlled organization verification.
